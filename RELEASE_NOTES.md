## 🔧 v0.1.0-beta.2 (2025-09-16) - Critical Compilation Fixes

### 🚨 Emergency Release - Fixes crates.io Compilation Errors

This is a critical hotfix release that resolves all compilation errors present in v0.1.0-beta.2 when downloaded from crates.io.

#### 🔥 Fixed Compilation Errors (100% resolved):
- **Variable Name Inconsistencies**: Fixed `chunk_size`/`chunksize`, `op_name`/`opname`, `target_unit`/`targetunit` mismatches
- **Undefined Variable References**: Fixed unresolved variables in batch conversion functions (`sequential`, `simd`, `parallel`, `simd_parallel`)
- **Pattern Match Errors**: Corrected pattern matching in SIMD conversion loops (`for (0, &val)` → `for (i, &val)` with proper indexing)
- **Function Name Conflicts**: Resolved duplicate `center()` function definitions by renaming constructor to `centered()`
- **Type Field References**: Fixed `type_info` field reference consistency

#### 📋 Technical Details:
- **Files Modified**: `batch_conversions.rs`, `types.rs`, `dynamic_dispatch.rs`
- **Total Errors Fixed**: 20+ compilation errors reduced to zero
- **Build Verification**: ✅ `cargo build` successful
- **Lint Check**: ✅ `cargo clippy` with zero warnings
- **Publication Ready**: ✅ `cargo publish --dry-run` successful

```rust
use scirs2::prelude::*;
use ndarray::Array2;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create and manipulate matrices
    let a = Array2::eye(3);
    let (u, s, vt) = scirs2::linalg::decomposition::svd(&a)?;
    
    // Statistical computations
    let normal = scirs2::stats::distributions::normal::Normal::new(0.0, 1.0)?;
    let samples = normal.random_sample(1000, None)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```
