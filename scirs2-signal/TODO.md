## Known Issues

- CEEMDAN with very short signals (<256 samples) may produce spurious IMFs; EEMD is more stable in this regime
- N4SID identification with high model orders (>20) requires well-conditioned data; use regularized variant
- NMF audio separation is sensitive to initialization; multiple random restarts recommended for reliable separation
