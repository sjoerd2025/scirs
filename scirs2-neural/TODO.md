## v0.4.0 Roadmap

### Attention — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] Flash Attention v2 (tiled memory-efficient attention)
- [x] Multi-query attention (MQA)
- [x] Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

### Quantization — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] INT4 weight-only quantization (src/quantization/int4.rs — group-quantized, nibble-packed)
- [x] INT8 activation quantization (src/quantization/int8.rs)
- [x] GPTQ-style post-training quantization (src/quantization/gptq.rs)

### Export and Interop — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] ONNX-like model export (src/export/onnx.rs — pure-Rust, oxicode serialization)
- [x] Weight conversion utilities for interop with other frameworks (src/export/weights.rs)

### Efficient Fine-Tuning — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) (src/lora/linear.rs)
- [x] Adapter layers (src/lora/adapter.rs — bottleneck adapters with optional residual)
- [x] Prefix tuning (src/layers/prefix_tuning.rs — reparameterized prefix tokens)

### Distributed Training — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] Gradient compression (TopK sparsification, PowerSGD) (src/training/gradient_compression.rs)
- [x] Pipeline parallelism (src/training/pipeline_parallel.rs — GPipe FThenB + 1F1B schedules)
- [x] Tensor parallelism primitives (src/training/tensor_parallel.rs — column/row parallel + parallel embedding)

### Architecture Search — Implemented in v0.4.0 (partially disabled)
- [x] Neural Architecture Search (NAS) integration (src/nas/ — ENAS, multi-objective, hardware-aware)
- [x] Differentiable NAS (DARTS/GDAS/SNAS) (src/nas/gdas.rs, src/nas/snas.rs)
- NOTE: `pub mod nas;` is disabled in lib.rs pending repair of truncated source files in nas/search_algorithms.rs and related files

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

- Some doc tests are marked `#[ignore]` pending API stabilization
- WASM target requires additional feature gating for large model weights
- GPU acceleration stubs exist in `hardware/` but require `scirs2-core::gpu` completion
- NAS module disabled in lib.rs: src/nas/search_algorithms.rs and several other nas/ files have truncated/malformed source (missing closing braces, mangled identifiers). Needs reconstruction before re-enabling `pub mod nas;`.
