## Known Issues

- The `MultinomialNaiveBayes` import was previously duplicated in `text_classification.rs`; resolved in v0.3.1.
- LDA coherence computation uses the corpus vocabulary; very small corpora may produce unreliable scores — document minimum corpus size recommendations.
- `abstractive_summary.rs` provides primitives only; full abstractive summarization requires a neural sequence-to-sequence model from `scirs2-neural`.
- Word2Vec training convergence depends heavily on `min_count` and corpus size; add validation warnings for very small corpora.
- FastText character n-gram support may increase memory significantly for large vocabulary sizes; document memory tradeoffs.
