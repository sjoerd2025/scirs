## Known Issues

- BDF order-5 may exhibit slow convergence near singular Jacobians; automatic order reduction to 3 recommended as workaround.
- LBM Shan-Chen multiphase currently only supports D2Q9; D3Q19 multiphase is planned for v0.4.0.
- IGA structural solver does not yet implement trimmed NURBS or multi-patch coupling.
- Port-Hamiltonian BEM coupling is implemented but not yet verified against the BEM module's matrix assembly.
- SPDE colored noise requires manual specification of the correlation kernel; automatic estimation is planned.
