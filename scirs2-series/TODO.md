## Known Issues

- DeepAR with negative-binomial output can exhibit numerical instability when series contain long runs of zeros; use TSB for highly intermittent demand instead
- FIGARCH estimation is slow for series longer than 10,000 points without the `parallel` feature enabled
- FPCA with very sparse observations (fewer than 5 observations per subject) may produce poorly estimated eigenfunctions
