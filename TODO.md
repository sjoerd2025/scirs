### Pure Rust Policy Enforcement and Dependency Cleanup

#### Completed in v0.3.4
- [x] Removed `ndarray-npy` from scirs2-core — eliminated `zip` crate from dependency tree entirely
- [x] Removed unused workspace deps: `x509-parser`, `itertools`, `num-rational`, `gmp-mpfr-sys`
- [x] Removed unused OTel deps: `opentelemetry-prometheus`, `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`
- [x] Removed unused scirs2-io stubs: `mongodb`, `redis`, `prost` (direct dep)
- [x] Fixed dangling feature refs: `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions` in scirs2-core `instrumentation` feature, `itertools` in scirs2-graph

#### Transitive Policy Violations (indirect deps from external crates)
These are pulled in by external crates we depend on — not direct violations, but targets for future Pure Rust replacements:

- [x] `flate2` + `zlib-rs` — pulled in transitively by:
  - `parquet` (scirs2-io) — flate2 for Parquet compression
  - `png` / `tiff` (image crate) — flate2 for image codec
  - `ureq` (scirs2-datasets) — flate2 for HTTP content encoding
  - **Action**: Evaluate Pure Rust Parquet alternatives or contribute upstream patches; for image/ureq these are internal to the crate and not directly replaceable
- [x] `snap` (Snappy) — pulled in by `parquet`
  - **Action**: Feature-gate `parquet` support so users who don't need it avoid these deps
- [x] `prost` (transitive) — pulled in by `opentelemetry-otlp` (scirs2-core)
  - **Action**: Consider whether OTel OTLP export is needed; if not, remove `opentelemetry-otlp` or feature-gate it

#### Barely-Used Dependencies (audit candidates)
- [x] `ureq` (8 uses) — overlaps with `reqwest` (80+ uses); consolidate HTTP client to one
- [x] `cron` (4 uses) — ensure properly feature-gated, not pulled into default builds
- [x] `opentelemetry_sdk` (4 uses) — verify necessity; most OTel setup is stub code
- [x] `num_bigint` (4 uses) — verify `arbitrary-precision` feature is not in default features
- [x] `egui` / `eframe` (~40 uses) — GUI deps; ensure feature-gated (visualization only)

#### Dead Code Cleanup
- [x] Audit `scirs2-core` JIT module — Cranelift crates removed but JIT stub code may remain in `array_protocol/jit_impl.rs`
- [x] Audit `scirs2-io` mongodb/redis feature stubs — feature names kept but deps removed; clean up cfg blocks if they contain only stub code
- [x] Audit `array_io` feature in scirs2-core — ndarray-npy removed; feature now only gates `["std", "array"]` which may be redundant

#### Dependency Reduction Goals for v0.4.0
- [x] Reduce total workspace dependency count by 15-20%
- [x] Ensure all default feature sets are 100% Pure Rust (no C/Fortran transitive deps)
- [x] Run `cargo tree --workspace --all-features -d` regularly to detect unnecessary version duplicates
- [x] Implement `cargo-scirs2-policy` linter check for banned direct deps (zip, flate2, bincode, openblas, etc.)

### Infrastructure and Tooling
- [x] WebGPU backend for scirs2-wasm (browser-side GPU compute via WebGPU API)
- [x] Python PyPI wheel distribution via maturin (Linux/macOS/Windows wheels)
- [x] mdBook documentation website with interactive examples and tutorials
- [x] Comprehensive benchmark regression suite (criterion-based with CI integration)
- [x] Jupyter notebook examples via evcxr Rust kernel
- [x] cargo-scirs2-policy linter: detect direct `use rand::*` / `use ndarray::` in non-core crates
- [x] Cross-platform Windows test suite improvements (full parity with Linux/macOS)
- [x] Julia binding improvements: JLL-based distribution for easier Julia package installation
- [x] Protocol buffer schema registry integration for scirs2-io

## Policy References

All development must adhere to the following policies:

- **No unwrap() Policy**: No `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code; use `?` and proper error handling
- **Pure Rust Policy**: Default feature set must be 100% Pure Rust (no C/Fortran); optional C-backed features must be feature-gated
- **COOLJAPAN Ecosystem Policy**: Use OxiBLAS (not OpenBLAS/MKL), OxiFFT (not rustfft/FFTW), oxiarc-* (not zip), oxicode (not bincode)
- **Workspace Policy**: All crate versions use `*.workspace = true`; no per-crate version declarations (except keywords/categories)
- **File Size Policy**: No single file > 2000 lines; use `splitrs` for refactoring (installed at `~/work/splitrs/`)
- **Naming Convention**: `snake_case` for all variables, functions, modules; `CamelCase` for types and traits
- **SciRS2 POLICY**: All non-core crates must use `scirs2-core` abstractions for rand/ndarray/num_complex access
