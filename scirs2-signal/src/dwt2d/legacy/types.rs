/// Result of a 2D DWT decomposition, containing the approximation and detail coefficients.
///
/// The 2D DWT decomposes an image into four subbands, each representing different
/// frequency components in horizontal and vertical directions. These subbands are
/// represented as separate 2D arrays (matrices) in this struct.
///
/// The coefficients represent the following subbands:
/// - `approx`: Low-frequency approximation coefficients (LL) - Represents the coarse, low-resolution version of the image
/// - `detail_h`: Horizontal detail coefficients (LH) - Captures horizontal edges (high frequency in horizontal direction)
/// - `detail_v`: Vertical detail coefficients (HL) - Captures vertical edges (high frequency in vertical direction)
/// - `detail_d`: Diagonal detail coefficients (HH) - Captures diagonal details (high frequency in both directions)
///
/// These four subbands together contain all the information needed to reconstruct
/// the original image. For multi-level decomposition, the approximation coefficients
/// are recursively decomposed into further subbands.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use scirs2_core::ndarray::Array2;
/// use scirs2_signal::dwt::Wavelet;
/// use scirs2_signal::dwt2d::{dwt2d_decompose, Dwt2dResult};
///
/// // Create a simple 4x4 image with a gradient pattern
/// let mut image = Array2::zeros((4, 4));
/// for i in 0..4 {
///     for j in 0..4 {
///         image[[i, j]] = (i * j)  as f64;
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Decompose the image
/// let result: Dwt2dResult = dwt2d_decompose(&image, Wavelet::Haar, None).unwrap();
///
/// // The image is now decomposed into four subbands:
/// let ll = &result.approx;  // Approximation coefficients (low-resolution image)
/// let lh = &result.detail_h;  // Horizontal details
/// let hl = &result.detail_v;  // Vertical details
/// let hh = &result.detail_d;  // Diagonal details
///
