## Known Issues / Technical Debt

- `spectral.rs` was deleted and replaced by the `spectral/` submodule; verify no broken re-exports remain
- `nufft_legacy.rs` backward-compatibility shim deprecated in v0.4.0 and marked for removal in v0.4.1
- EMD cubic spline envelope may not converge for highly non-stationary signals; add iteration cap with warning
- NTT works only for inputs whose length divides `p - 1`; document this constraint clearly
- Lomb-Scargle FAP estimation is approximate (chi-squared); implement bootstrap alternative
- Several spectral analysis files exceed 2000 lines; use `rslines 50` to identify split targets
- GPU sparse FFT feature flags (`cuda`, `hip`, `sycl`) depend on external hardware; CI uses mock backend
- STFT `istft` reconstruction requires correct `noverlap`; add assertion for perfect reconstruction condition
- Wavelet packet tree reconstruction is not yet invertible for all wavelet families; test suite should cover round-trip error
