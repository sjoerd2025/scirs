## Known Issues

- Kriging with very large nugget values (> 0.5 * signal variance) may produce numerically unstable Cholesky factorizations; increasing nugget regularization is the current workaround.
- Natural Neighbor interpolation does not extrapolate beyond the convex hull of the data; it returns an error for out-of-hull queries.
- NURBS surface fitting is implemented for structured (grid-like) point clouds; unstructured point cloud fitting requires the scattered-2D module.
- Meshless partition-of-unity methods require a minimum patch overlap ratio of 1.5x; smaller overlaps cause oscillation in the unity partition.
- B-spline surface fitting performance degrades for large grids (> 200x200 control points) due to dense system assembly; sparse assembly is planned.
