## Known Issues

- `plotly_backend` feature generates HTML that requires a network connection to load Chart.js from CDN; add offline/bundled mode.
- `dashboard_server` requires `tokio` runtime; document how to integrate with existing async applications.
- SIMD acceleration is only available on x86/x86_64 targets; ARM NEON support is planned for v0.4.0.
- The `generative` module (FID, IS) requires pre-computed feature vectors; it does not include the Inception network — document this clearly.
