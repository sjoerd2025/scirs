## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
scirs2-neural = "0.4.2"
```

With optional features:

```toml
[dependencies]
scirs2-neural = { version = "0.4.2", features = ["parallel"] }
```

### Building a Sequential MLP

```rust
use scirs2_neural::prelude::*;
use scirs2_core::random::rng;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut rng = rng();

    let mut model = Sequential::<f32>::new();
    model.add(Dense::new(784, 256, Some("relu"), &mut rng)?);
    model.add(Dense::new(256, 128, Some("relu"), &mut rng)?);
    model.add(Dense::new(128, 10, None, &mut rng)?);

    println!("Model: {} layers", model.len());
    Ok(())
}
```

### Using Transformer Attention

```rust
use scirs2_neural::layers::attention::MultiHeadAttention;
use scirs2_core::random::rng;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut rng = rng();
    // 8 heads, 64-dim model, 16-dim key/value
    let attn = MultiHeadAttention::<f32>::new(8, 64, 16, &mut rng)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Knowledge Distillation

```rust
use scirs2_neural::training::knowledge_distillation::{
    DistillationConfig, KnowledgeDistillationTrainer,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = DistillationConfig {
        temperature: 4.0,
        alpha: 0.7,   // weight for soft targets
        ..Default::default()
    };
    // Pair teacher and student models, then call trainer.train()
    Ok(())
}
```

### Graph Neural Network

```rust
use scirs2_neural::layers::gnn::{GCNLayer, GATLayer};
use scirs2_core::random::rng;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut rng = rng();
    let gcn = GCNLayer::<f32>::new(32, 64, &mut rng)?;
    let gat = GATLayer::<f32>::new(64, 32, 4, &mut rng)?; // 4 attention heads
    Ok(())
}
```
