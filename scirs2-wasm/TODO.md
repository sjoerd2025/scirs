## v0.4.0 Roadmap

### WebGPU Compute Shaders
- [x] WebGPU backend for GPU-accelerated matrix multiply — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`webgpu/matmul.rs`)
- [x] WGSL compute shaders for batch operations — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`webgpu/shader_gen.rs`, `webgpu/operations.rs`)
- [x] Fallback to WASM when WebGPU unavailable — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`webgpu/backend.rs`)
- [ ] Benchmark: target 10x speedup over WASM for large matrices

### SharedArrayBuffer / Zero-Copy
- [x] Zero-copy array sharing between main thread and workers via `SharedArrayBuffer` — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`parallel/` module)
- [ ] `Atomics`-based synchronization for concurrent reads
- [ ] Requires COOP/COEP headers (document in setup guide)

### Streaming Large Datasets
- [ ] Async streaming API for datasets that do not fit in WASM memory
- [x] Lazy FFT for streaming audio/sensor data — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`streaming_fft/` module)
- [x] Incremental PCA on streaming data — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`incremental_pca.rs` module)

### Expanded Signal Processing

- [x] Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with overlap-add reconstruction — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`signal_enhanced.rs` `wasm_stft`; overlap-add via `signal_enhanced.rs` convolution path)
- [x] Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`mfcc.rs` module)

### Usability Improvements
- [ ] Automatic memory management with `FinalizationRegistry`
- [ ] Detailed error messages surfaced to JS with error codes
- [ ] `scirs2-wasm-react` helper hooks package
- [ ] npm publish automation via GitHub Actions

### Testing & CI
- [ ] Playwright-based end-to-end tests in real browsers
- [ ] Benchmarks vs `ml5.js`, `tfjs-wasm` for comparable operations
- [ ] Automated WASM binary size regression tracking

## Known Issues

- `SharedArrayBuffer` requires Cross-Origin Isolation (`COOP`/`COEP` headers); document this requirement in the setup guide.
- Safari SIMD support is partial; `has_simd_support()` returns `false` on affected versions.
- WASM memory cannot be released back to the OS once grown; encourage array reuse for long-running applications.
- WebWorker message passing copies data; zero-copy requires `SharedArrayBuffer` (v0.4.0 target).
